# ReproLabV2 - Enhanced Azure AD Hybrid Authentication Lab

> This is an enhanced version of ReproLab with improved flexibility, security, and modern features.

This template will deploy a comprehensive Windows Server lab environment (2012 R2, 2016, 2019, 2022, or 2025) that can be used for testing Azure AD hybrid authentication scenarios, single sign-on, and federation services.

## üöÄ What's New in V2

### Enhanced Features
- **Multiple OS Support**: Choose from Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, 2022, or 2025
- **Flexible VM Sizing**: Select from Standard_B2s, Standard_DS1_v2, or Standard_D2s_v3 based on your needs
- **Enhanced Security**: Restrict RDP access to your specific public IP address
- **Cost Optimization**: Choose appropriate VM sizes for your budget and performance requirements

### Planned Enhancements (Coming Soon)
- Additional modern authentication scenarios
- Improved automation and deployment experience
- Enhanced monitoring and logging capabilities
- Better integration with modern Azure services

## ÔøΩÔøΩÔ∏è Architecture

### Networking
The virtual network has two subnets with enhanced security:
- **External subnet**: Internet-facing resources with restricted access
- **Internal subnet**: Domain-joined resources with internal-only access
- **Network Security Groups**: Configured with least-privilege access principles
- **IP Restriction**: Optional public IP whitelisting for RDP access

### Virtual Machines
This template deploys four specialized VMs:

1. **Remote Desktop Jump Server/ADFS Proxy** (external subnet)
2. **Domain Controller** (internal subnet) - with AD DS
3. **ADFS Farm Server** (internal subnet) - for federation services  
4. **Synchronization Server** (internal subnet) - for Azure AD Connect

### Active Directory Domain Services
- Single-domain forest deployment and configuration
- Pre-populated organizational structure with realistic test data
- 25+ test users across 4 departments (Accounting, IT, Marketing, Operations)
- Realistic organizational hierarchy and reporting structure

## üìã Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- Basic understanding of hybrid identity concepts
- Your public IP address (for secure RDP access)

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Options/Default |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **OS Version** | Windows Server version | 2012 R2, 2016, 2019 (default), 2022, 2025 |
| **VM Size** | Virtual machine size for all VMs | Standard_DS1_v2 (default), Standard_B2s, Standard_D2s_v3 |
| **Public IP** | Your public IP for RDP restriction | Optional security enhancement |
